## Setting the Scene üé¨
A company requires a five-year strategy to maximise the chances of its long-term viability. The current situation of the company was outlined and minimum, most likely and maximum values of gold income, cost and new claim ventures were provided. There was also an extra legal challenge where the company could decide to resolve the case (and risk losing everything) or delay the case and pay a legal fee each year. The probability of resolving this case in the company's favour was 50% (to me, this wasn't enough to risk everything). The company also had the opportunity to invest money into acquiring a new claim, however the chance of discover was only 15%.

## Calculations
To begin, the basic calculations had to be figured out over the five years in order for the Monte Carlo Simulation to be used. The data can be seen below:

## Final Comments
This task was very open to interpretation, which almost made it harder to begin. There are many strategies/options that could've been taken, however I chose to stick with the four options outlined above.
